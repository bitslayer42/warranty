If it is json or xml you can use the new xbasic functions although I don't recall where they are documented. 
The following is a simple example with limited error handling which accesses a non authenticated custom json service.

'ESB json demo
debug(1)
dim response as p
response=http_get("http://localhost:53961/api/salusdata/GetAmendmentsPending","" ,53961,80000 )
if response.parsed_headers.status_code=404
'not found
dim code as n
code = UI_ATTENTION_SYMBOL
dim r as n
r = ui_msg_box("WARNING", "No Amendment(s) found" , code)	
else
dim json as p
json = json_parse(response.body)
end if
